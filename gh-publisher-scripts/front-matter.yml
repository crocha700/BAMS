title: Seasonality in governing upper-ocean dynamics at submesoscales
abstract: Submesoscale (10-100 km) vertical vorticity and lateral strain peak in late Winter/early Spring; divergence and stratification peak in late Summer/early Fall. Quasi-balanced turbulence dominates the variability in late Winter/early Spring; inertia-gravity waves dominate in late Summer/early Fall.  These results have implications for the diagnosis of surface velocity from the upcomming SWOT and COMPIRA satellite missions.
